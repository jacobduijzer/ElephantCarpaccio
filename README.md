# Elephant Carpaccio

The [Elephant Carpaccio exercise](https://alistair.cockburn.us/coming-soon/) is a great way for software people to practice & learn how to break stories into really thin vertical slices. It also leads to interesting discussions about quality and tech practices. The exercise was invented by Alistair Cockburn. Weâ€™ve cofacilitated it a bunch of times and we encourage people to run it everywhere. This is a detailed (shu-level) facilitation guide based on how Alistair runs it plus some minor adaptations from Henrik. The exercise takes 90-120 minutes, and scales well. We normally do it with 10-20 people but have also done it with groups up to 30.
